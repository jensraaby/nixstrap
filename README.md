nixstrap
========
This is my bootstrap repo for setting up new machines.
It's a collection of shell scripts, intended to replace boxen for my personal
machines.

It uses:
- thoughtbot's RCM tool for managing dotfile symlinks.
- ZSH for the shell
- homebrew to install pretty much everything apart from App Store Apps
